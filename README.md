Meeting Minutes (Only record decision that has been made)
Meeting 1
STM32F407G will be used as our mainframe
VEML3328 will be our main sensor as it provides both the light intensity and color type. 
User will choose the mode, and according to that, the output light will change its characteristics. (haven’t decided on how to determine this yet)
Our objective is to build the back-end of IOT’s. In this case, the back-end of smart light bulbs. We aim to make the back-end work on any kind of smart light bulb brand out there. 
Meeting on Wednesday night.
